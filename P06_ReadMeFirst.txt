P06 Execution Notes
====================

P06 is meant to be a test exam - a simulation of the final exam at the end of the course. 
The goal is for you to get a better feeling of where you stand and where you might have gaps.

This test exam is a very close translation into Python of 2013's final Java exam. This means: The given tasks and time (each point translates roughly into one minute of time) are realistic for a final exam.

To make the most out of it, you should take the the exam under conditions as similar to a final exam as possible; therefore:
 - *Don't* look into the exercises before the first lab session
 - During the first lab session, solve as much of the exercises silently and individually
 - Don't ask your neighbors, don't consult the internet; you may use all your notes and the course material and Skript, though.
 - Solve any outstanding exercises individually at home after the first week's lab session
 - Solutions will be discussed in the second week's lab session

Grading of P06 solely depends on attending the two lab sessions personally; *not* on the results of your test.
